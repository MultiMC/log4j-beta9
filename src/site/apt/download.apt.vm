    It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures.
    Please read {{{http://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html}Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases}} for more
    information on why you should verify our releases.

    The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the
    {{{http://www.apache.org/dist/logging/KEYS}KEYS}} as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution.
    Make sure you get these files from the {{{http://www.apache.org/dist/logging/}main distribution directory}}, rather
    than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using

---
% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify apache-log4j-${Log4jReleaseVersion}-bin.tar.gz.asc
---

    Apache Log4j 2 is signed by Ralph Goers  B3D8E1BA

    Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files. A unix program called md5 or md5sum is included
    in many unix distributions.



* Previous Releases

  All previous releases of Apache log4j can be found in the
  {{{http://archive.apache.org/dist/logging/log4j}archive repository}}.
