				<p>Apache Log4j 2 is not compatible with the previous versions. Please have the following in mind
				when upgrading to Log4j 2 in your project:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Java 6 is required</li>
          <li>The XML configuration has been simplified and is not compatible with Log4j 1.x</li>
          <li>Configuration via property files is not supported.</li>
          <li>Configuration via JSON is supported.</li>
          <li>Although Log4j 2 is not directly compatible with Log4j 1.x a compatibility bridge
            has been provided to reduce the need to make coding changes.</li>
				</ul>
