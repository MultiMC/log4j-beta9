        <section name="Log4j 1.2 Bridge">

            <p>
              The Log4j 1.2 Bridge allows applications coded to use Log4j 1.2 API to use
              Log4j 2 instead.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section name="Requirements">
           <p>
             The Log4j 1.2 bridge requires at least Java 6 and is dependent on the Log4j 2 API and implementation.
          </p>
        </section>

      <section name="Usage">
        <p>
          To use the Log4j Legacy Bridge just remove all the Log4j 1.x jars from the application and replace them
          with the bridge jar. Once in place all logging that uses Log4j 1.x will be routed to Log4j 2. However,
          applications that attempt to modify legacy Log4j by adding Appenders, Filters, etc may experience problems
          if they try to verify the success of these actions as these methods are largely no-ops.
