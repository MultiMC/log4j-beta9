/**
 * The converters in this package implement the JPA 2.1 mechanism for converting non-standard types to and from
 * database fields. Most of these types are capable of two-way conversion and can be used to both persist and retrieve
 * entities. The 
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jpa.converter.ContextMapAttributeConverter ContextMapAttributeConverter} 
 * and {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jpa.converter.ContextStackAttributeConverter ContextStackAttributeConverter} 
 * only support persistence and not retrieval, persisting the type as a simple string. You can use the
 * {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jpa.converter.ContextMapJsonAttributeConverter ContextMapJsonAttributeConverter} 
 * and {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jpa.converter.ContextStackJsonAttributeConverter ContextStackJsonAttributeConverter}
 * instead, which require the Jackson Data Processor dependency to also be on your class path.
